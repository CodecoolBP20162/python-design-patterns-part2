# State

Find a real example where the State design pattern can be used. So have two similar classes doing something similar (Implementation classes), and have a new class fulfilling the State pattern.

Be creative, let your mind fly! :-)

*One idea for the lazy: Put some large text files into a folder (grab some utf-8 plain text books from [http://www.gutenberg.org/](http://www.gutenberg.org/)), and create a class to handle a file's loading and outputting some lines to console by a given filename. Access the files in the folder several times but do not load the files more than once from the disk.*
