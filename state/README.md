# State

Find a real example where the State design pattern can be used. So have two similar classes doing something similar (Implementation classes), and have a new class fulfilling the State pattern.

Be creative, let your mind fly! :-)

*One idea for the lazy: Put some large text files into a folder (grab some utf-8 plain text books from [http://www.gutenberg.org/](http://www.gutenberg.org/)), then create a class to represent one file by a given filename. This class should handle the file's loading and outputting some lines to console. Access the files in the folder several times but do not load the files more than once from the disk.*
